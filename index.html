            <p>My name is Thomas J. Trebat. I am 31 years old and currently reside on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. In my
                spare time, I enjoy playing golf, taking walks around the city, reading and watching television.</p>
            <p>In the Spring of 2009, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Gettysburg College, in Pennsylvania.
                Also, I am currently seeking entry into a graduate-level degree program to further pursue my interests within
                the subject of Computer Science.</p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am studying to become a competent full-stack web developer with expertise and knowledge in HTML, CSS and Javascript
                programming. I am an active participant in a Coding Boot Camp program at Columbia University to help bring
                my programming skills up-to-date using latest web development technologies in projects. I have my sights
                on employment with a company that will engage my interests in web development and computer programming.
