            <p>My name is Thomas J. Trebat and I am 31 years old currently residing on the Upper West Side of
                Manhattan. In my
                spare time, I enjoy playing golf, taking walks around the city, reading and watching television.</p>
            <p>In the Spring of 2009, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Gettysburg College, in
                Pennsylvania.
                I am currently seeking entry into a graduate-level degree program to further continue in my pursuit of
                interest within
                the subject of Computer Science.</p>
            <p>
                I am studying to become a full-stack web developer with expertise in
                HTML, CSS and Javascript
                programming. Also, I am an active participant in the Columbia University Coding Boot Camp program to
                help me
                achieve my goals in becoming a developer with use of the latest web development technologies.
